# lmml-solutions

>ℹ️ During LMML, we had a couple of challenges that were a bit more complex to solve (at least based on the number of people that actually managed to solve them). And since the goal of this entire series of events is to help people learn, this will be the official repository for the solutions and explanations of the most requested challenges!

You can find the solutions and the tasks inside the `challenges` folder. Each challenge has its own folder and in each README.md file you can find the explanation of how to reach the solution.
